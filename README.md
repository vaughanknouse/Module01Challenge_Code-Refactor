# Module 01 Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description
Repository to complete the Module 1 Challenge: Code Refactor

The motivation for this project was to assist a marketing agency with refactoring an existing codebase so that it follows accessibility standards so that their own website is optimized for search engines.

This project was built to improve the web accessibility of the website so that people with disabilities can access the website using assistive technologies. An accessible website also is beneficial for businesses as accessible websites have improved positions in search engines such as Google or Yahoo. Finally, web accessibility also helps avoid litigation for companies when individuals with disabilities are unable to access their website. 

The project solved the concern of refactoring an existing website to make it more accessible.

Throughout this project I learned the significance of web accessibility and how even the smallest of details can make a large impact on users.


## Usage

Copy of refactored code from an existing site as requested by a marketing agency in order to improve the code so that it may be more accessible without changing what the code does.
